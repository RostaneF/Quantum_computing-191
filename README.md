# Quantum Computing 191

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding the fascinating world of Quantum Computing. With the resources and code snippets provided here, we aim to provide insights into the principles and applications of Quantum Computing.

## Contents

- `Code.py`: A Python script that contains code related to Quantum Computing algorithms and implementations.
- `Notebook_QuantumComputing.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides an interactive environment to run and explore Quantum Computing code and theories.
- `Quantum_Computing_191.pdf`: A research and popularization document that provides theoretical information, explanations, and research findings related to Quantum Computing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) or any relevant Quantum Computing library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RostaneF/Quantum_computing-191.git
   ```
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Quantum_computing-191
   ```

### Usage

- Open and run the Python script `Code.py` using your preferred IDE.
